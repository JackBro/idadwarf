How to compile IDADWARF?
------------------------

IDADWARF is an IDA plugin for Windows, but you must compile it on a Linux system.

Why? Because I developed the plugin on a Linux-based netbook.

That means:
* MinGW acts as a cross-compiler
* IDA (and IDADWARF) runs via Wine.

Don't be afraid, the plugin runs natively on Windows too.

IDADWARF has some dependencies:
* MinGW: installed as a cross-compiler on a Linux host.
  http://www.mingw.org
* libelf: the GNU one, preferably version 0.8.13
  http://www.mr511.de/software/
* libdwarf: the open-sourced library from SGI, preferably version 20091012
  http://reality.sgiweb.org/davea/dwarf.html
* the 'autoconf' program from the autotools
  http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
* the IDA SDK, preferably version 5.5 (but anterior 5.x versions should work)

To compile the plugin, follow these steps:
* edit the src/Makefile file
  the following variables need to be adapted to your configuration:
  + CC (the MinGW C++ cross-compiler)
  + RANLIB (the MinGW ranlib)
  + ELFDIR (the libelf source path)
  + DWARFDIR (the libdwarf source path)
  + IDAINC (include directory in the IDA SDK)
  + IDALIB (the IDA static library for GCC)
  + IDADIR (directory where the idag.exe binary is)
* build the plugin, in the src/ directory:
  make
  (the 'make' command will build libelf and libdwarf too,
   the resulting plugin is named idadwarf.plw.)
* or if you want a debug build, type:
  DEBUG=1 make
  (the only change in a debug build is that lots of debug
   messages are printed to the IDA messages window.)
* copy the plugin to the IDA plugin directory:
  make install
* or copy the plugin in the bin/ directory:
  make dist
* test if all is working correctly:
  make test
* clean all you have done
  make distclean
