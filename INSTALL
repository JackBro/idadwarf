How to compile IDADWARF?
------------------------

IDADWARF is an IDA plugin for Windows, but you must compile it on a Linux system.

Why? Because I developed the plugin on a Linux-based netbook.

That means:
* MinGW acts as a cross-compiler
* IDA (and IDADWARF) runs via Wine.

Don't be afraid, the plugin should also run natively on Windows.

IDADWARF has some dependencies:
* libelf: the GNU one, but another one with the same System V Release 4 API will do...

* libdwarf: the open-sourced library from SGI.

* the IDA SDK
