* get rid of libelf: use the ELF loader from IDA
* add ellipsis argument (...) support in function prototypes (only supported in function pointer types for now)
* add bitfield support
* add C++ support
* when C++ support is done, draw UML diagrams of the program object hierarchy via the graph API
* memory debugging, there may be plenty of memleaks...
* add amd64 (and sparc?) support
* use argloc_t in function prototypes
* give the interesting infos from the debugging symbols to the Hex-Rays decompiler (how to do that?)
* static analysis stuff (see the Muchnick book :)
